        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,

       “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined<br> the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
       transition and have heard some people who<br> had an amazing experience here. I signed up<br> 
       for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
       The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time<br> of my life. Since completing 
       the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and

      <p>
        “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about<br> my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
        gave me the confidence necessary to<br> be able to go out in the world and present<br> myself as a capable 
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from

        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

      <p>
        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never<br> written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged<br> to enroll by a former 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.<br> The entire curriculum and staff 
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I<br> never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that<br> no tutorial 
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example<br> of my developent 
        experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
        100% recommend! ”
